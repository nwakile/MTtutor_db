                <p>
                    "A 62-year-old woman is evaluated during a follow-up appointment 12 weeks after she completed treatment for
                    genotype 1a hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. She has Child-Turcotte-Pugh Class A cirrhosis
                    (well-compensated cirrhosis). Small esophageal varices were noted on upper endoscopy 1 year earlier.
                    On physical examination, vital signs are normal; BMI is 26. Palmar erythema, spider angiomata over the
                    chest, a firm liver edge 3 cm below the costal margin, and a palpable spleen tip are noted. The examination
                    is otherwise normal.
                    Her HCV RNA is undetectable and her calculated Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score is 8. Which of the
                    following is the most appropriate management for this patient?"

                <h3>Answer and Critique</h3>
                <h5>Correct answer: C. Ultrasonography of the liver every 6 months </h5>
                <p>
                    "International guidelines for patients with cirrhosis suggest ultrasound examination
                    every 6 months for early detection of HCC. The main goal is to detect neoplastic nodules
                    less than 2â€‰cm.  Real-time ultrasound, in combination with color flow Doppler US, is currently
                    the most frequently used diagnostic imaging modality worldwide in the screening and evaluation
                    of patients with cirrhosis. In addition to demonstrating the morphologic characteristics of
                    cirrhosis, including hepatic contour, texture, and the presence of portal collaterals,
                    Doppler US provides useful information on portal hemodynamics."
